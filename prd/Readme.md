# Ames Housing Azure ML Product Requirements Document
**Author**: Lubomir Straka [LS]
> A product requirements document (PRD)  is a guide that defines a particular **product’s requirements**, including its purpose, features, functionality, and behavior. This document is generally written by the Product Manager to communicate **what** they are building, **who** it is for, and **how** it benefits the end-user. It also serves as a guide for business and technical teams to help **develop, launch, and market** the product.

# Change History
> A PRD is a living document that should be continuously updated according to the product’s lifecycle.
+ 2021-07-28 LS starts a new PRD.

# Overview
> Briefly, what is this project about?  Why are you doing it?

A value proposition of this project has three levels, let's call them context, content, and code levels.
+ A **context (strategy) level** offers an example of a data science solution to a business problem. It approaches data science solution as a business product that needs a clear and concise technical specification to address the business problem in a proper way.
+ A **content (story line) level** introduces one canonical data mining task, namely regression or value estimation. This task attempts to estimate or predict for each house in Ames real estate dataset its sale price. The Ames Housing dataset hosted on Kaggle.com povides the content for data minining.
+ A **code (procedural) level** serves the need of passing the capstone project assignment in Udacity Machine Learning Engineer in Azure Nanadegree Program. This level determines application and infrastructure components of the data science solution.
