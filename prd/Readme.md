# Ames Housing Azure ML Product Requirements Document
**Author**: Lubomir Straka [LS]
> A product requirements document (PRD)  is a guide that defines a particular **product’s requirements**, including its purpose, features, functionality, and behavior. This document is generally written by the Product Manager to communicate **what** they are building, **who** it is for, and **how** it benefits the end-user. It also serves as a guide for business and technical teams to help **develop, launch, and market** the product.

# Change History
> A PRD is a living document that should be continuously updated according to the product’s lifecycle.
+ 2021-07-28 LS starts writing a new PRD.

# Overview
> Briefly, what is this project about?  Why are you doing it?

A value proposition of this project has three levels, let's call them context, content, and code levels.
+ A **context (strategy) level** offers an example of a data science solution to a business problem. It approaches a machine learning solution as a business product or contract that needs a technical specification which is clear, concise, testable, traceable, and correct.
+ A **content (or story line) level** is about one of the canonical data mining tasks. The goal of the project on this level is to estimate or predict sale prices of houses in Ames with a regression model trained on historical data. The Ames Housing dataset is downloadable from Kaggle.com. It is located in House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques ongoing competition connected with one of Kaggle's tutorials.
+ A **code (procedural) level** serves the need of passing the capstone project assignment in Udacity Machine Learning Engineer in Azure Nanadegree Program. This level determines application and infrastructure components of the data science solution.
